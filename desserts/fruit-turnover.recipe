# Fruit turnover

> Turnovers from puff pastry, fill with fresh fruit or jam. Makes 4-5. #desserts #vegetarian

- puff pastry | about 265g | see puff-pastry recipe
- egg | 1 | Optional, beaten
- coarse sugar | sprinkle | Optional

Example fillings:

- Saut√©ed apples with lemon juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, and salt
- Blackberry jam, with lemon juice, allspice, and corn starch

Preheat the oven to 400F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Roll out the dough into a 12-inch square. Use flour as you go to prevent sticking.

Cut into 4 squares, scraps can be used to make a 5th or just a tasty little baked puff pastry.

Add filling to each, leaving about 3/4" of border. Fold the edges of the dough over the filing

Crimp the edges closed with your fingers and then with a fork.

Move the turnovers to baking sheet.

Optional: Brush each pie with the beaten egg yolk. Important not to let the egg drip down the sides, this glues them to the pan and prevents them from rising as much.

Optional: Sprinkle with coarse sugar.

20 minute [Bake] or until golden brown and puffy.
