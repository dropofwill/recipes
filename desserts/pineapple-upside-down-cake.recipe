- Vegan butter | 4 tablespoons

> Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

> Place skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Once it melts, stir in the brown sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar melts, about two minutes. Remove from heat and add the drained sliced pineapple.

> To a large mixing bowl, add the applesauce or eggs, canola oil, sugar, pineapple juice, and vanilla. Mix until combined.

> Add the flour, baking powder, and salt over the wet ingredients. Mix the dry ingredients with the wet until incorporated.

> Spread the batter evenly over the top of the pineapple.

> Bake for about 35 minutes, until the cake begins to turn golden brown on the top and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake layer comes out clean.

> Remove from oven and let cool for about 10 minutes.

> Have a large cake plate or tray ready. Loosen the sides of the cake with a butter knife. Place the platter upside down over the top of the skillet and quickly flip the skillet over, inverting the cake onto the platter.

> Serve immediately or let cool completely then refrigerate until ready to serve.
